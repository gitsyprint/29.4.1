# Capstone Two Final Report: Integrating Price Signals and LLM Sentiment for SPY Prediction
## Introduction
### This project investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide incremental predictive power for financial forecasting. Specifically, it asks: *italic* Can LLM-derived sentiment improve daily predictive models of SPY ETF returns when combined with standard price-based technical features?
### With markets increasingly influenced by real-time news, investors and analysts are turning to language models to mine headlines for tradable signals. The goal of this project was to quantify whether sentiment extracted from financial news using FinBERT, a finance-tuned transformer, could improve upon traditional technical indicators. By testing predictive models both with and without sentiment features, the project evaluated the standalone and incremental predictive value of LLM-derived news sentiment at the daily frequency.
